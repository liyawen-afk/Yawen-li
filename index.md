## About Me

I am a Professor of Social Work at California State University, San Bernardino, where I also serve as Vice Chair of the Institutional Review Board and Executive Board Member of the Center on Aging.

My research focuses on **long-term care services for older adults**, with particular emphasis on adult day services, organizational capacity in healthcare settings, and health disparities among minority populations. I am especially interested in how community-based care organizations adapt to changing policy, demographic, and technological environments.

I am currently Principal Investigator on an NIH-funded study examining dynamic capabilities in adult day health services across the United States.
