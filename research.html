    <h1>Research</h1>
    
    <p>My research program centers on understanding how community-based long-term care services can better serve older adults, particularly those from minority backgrounds.</p>

    <h2>Current Projects</h2>

    <h3>Measuring Dynamic Capability of Adult Day Health Services</h3>
    <p><strong>NIH/NIGMS R16 (2025–2029) | $588,000</strong></p>
    <p>This study examines how adult day services centers across the United States sense environmental changes, adapt their operations, and continuously improve to meet the evolving needs of older adults and their families.</p>

    <h3>Electronic Health Records in Adult Day Services</h3>
    <p>Investigating patterns and predictors of EHR adoption among adult day services centers using national data from the National Study of Long-Term Care Providers.</p>

    <h3>Binaural Beat Stimulation for Cognitive Impairment</h3>
    <p>A community-based pilot study exploring the efficacy of music-based interventions for patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.</p>

    <h2>Research Themes</h2>

    <h3>Organizational Capacity in Long-Term Care</h3>
    <p>How do adult day services centers develop and maintain the capabilities needed to thrive in a changing healthcare landscape? My work applies management theory—specifically the concept of dynamic capabilities—to understand organizational adaptation in this sector.</p>

    <h3>Health Technology Adoption</h3>
    <p>What factors facilitate or hinder the adoption of electronic health records and health information exchange among community-based care providers?</p>

    <h3>Minority Aging and Health Disparities</h3>
    <p>How can services be designed and delivered to better meet the needs of ethnically diverse older adult populations, particularly Chinese Americans?</p>

    <h3>Dementia Care</h3>
    <p>What community-based interventions can support individuals living with dementia and their caregivers?</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Methodological Approaches</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Secondary analysis of national survey data</li>
      <li>Qualitative interviews with care providers and administrators</li>
      <li>GIS-based spatial accessibility analysis</li>
      <li>Community-based participatory research</li>
      <li>Measurement development and validation</li>
    </ul>
