## Research Themes

### Organizational Capacity in Long-Term Care
How do adult day services centers develop and maintain the capabilities needed to thrive in a changing healthcare landscape? My work applies management theory—specifically the concept of dynamic capabilities—to understand organizational adaptation in this sector.

### Health Technology Adoption
What factors facilitate or hinder the adoption of electronic health records and health information exchange among community-based care providers?

### Minority Aging and Health Disparities
How can services be designed and delivered to better meet the needs of ethnically diverse older adult populations, particularly Chinese Americans?

### Dementia Care
What community-based interventions can support individuals living with dementia and their caregivers?
